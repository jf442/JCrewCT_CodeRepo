- Plan for next week
  - Come up with more **technology/process improvement** related ideas that would affect the customer experience
  - Market reserach, customer interviews, look up relevant customer activity data
  - Talk to faculty advisors to learn how to integrate operatiosn research into the design
- Key learnings and actions from your weekly retro
  - We talked too fast during presentation --> bad engagement 
  - Focus on the narrative around the prodcut and let the demo support the narrative better
  - Incorporate tech related content to the presentation 
- Risks
  - Starting from scratch, running low on time
  - Technology solutions might require high initial investments and more serious validations

### Week 6 Research
- Progress this week
  - [User Findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bl7DeKl-SrKuea8e06HaOWtRDu8C16iHer_SU2HNGTA/edit).
    - Key insights:
      - something
      - something
      - something
  - Brainstormed new directions and potentials to combine multi-channel shopping
    - A personalized/interactive web page for users + point system to encourage interaction + try it in store 
  - Obtained faculty advisor's input
    - Use SVD to implement personalized feeds
    - Need user transaction data --> need to ask Brian for help
    - They supported the "why" behind our product  
- Plan for next week
  - Contact Brian for data to use to build the prototype
  - Prepare for Crit
  - Reflect on Crit
  - Start laying out structure for prototype 
  - More background research on personalized recommendation feed
    - potential sources: Facebook, Netflix, Tinder, Amazon 
- Key learnings and actions from your weekly retro
  - Need to present our idea more properly to Brian to engage him
  - Tech is not driving the product --> should not be a "solution looking for problem"
- Risks
  - If data is not available, need to simulate our own
  - Might not have enough information/data on individuals to create a really personalized feeds/recommendations
  - Negative connotation towards Tinder-like interactive web page
