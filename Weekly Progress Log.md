  - Research on retail industry best practice on channeling online stores with brick & mortar stores
    - Brands to reference: GAP, Ann Taylor, Ebay, Old Navy, Lululemon
- Plan for next week
  - Come up with more **technology/process improvement** related ideas that would affect the customer experience
  - Market reserach, customer interviews, look up relevant customer activity data
  - Talk to faculty advisors to learn how to integrate operatiosn research into the design
- Key learnings and actions from your weekly retro
  - We talked too fast during presentation --> bad engagement 
  - Focus on the narrative around the prodcut and let the demo support the narrative better
  - Incorporate tech related content to the presentation 
- Risks
  - Starting from scratch, running low on time
  - Technology solutions might require high initial investments and more serious validations

### Week 6 Research
- Progress this week
  - [User Findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bl7DeKl-SrKuea8e06HaOWtRDu8C16iHer_SU2HNGTA/edit).
    - Key insights:
      - For adults when they purchase, it's more likely for a specific occasion so they often know vaguely what they want
      - If both channels are present and easily accessible, people will have their own way of merging those two in a way that makes the most sense to them
      - Need smoother and more transparent online payment system in terms of what type of errors occured in the transaction
      - People prioritize convenience and quality
  - Brainstormed new directions and potentials to combine multi-channel shopping
    - A personalized/interactive web page for users + point system to encourage interaction + try it in store 
  - Obtained faculty advisor's input
    - Use SVD to implement personalized feeds
    - Need user transaction data --> need to ask Brian for help
    - They supported the "why" behind our product  
- Plan for next week
  - Contact Brian for data to use to build the prototype
  - Prepare for Crit
  - Reflect on Crit
  - Start laying out structure for prototype 
  - More background research on personalized recommendation feed
    - potential sources: Facebook, Netflix, Tinder, Amazon 
- Key learnings and actions from your weekly retro
  - Need to present our idea more properly to Brian to engage him
  - Tech is not driving the product --> should not be a "solution looking for problem"
- Risks
  - If data is not available, need to simulate our own
  - Might not have enough information/data on individuals to create a really personalized feeds/recommendations
  - Negative connotation towards Tinder-like interactive web page 
  
### Week 7 Iterate
- Progress this week
  - [Crit 1 findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18_y-KxBQ_z8mMFFdmcd_GFZY78b00Xhd_r5VWHHqr2E/edit).
    - Key insights:
      - "intake survey" reference on MM. Lafleur
      - Need to define the target user group more carefully
      - Explore trial run could be interesting
      - Confirmed why traffic in retail store is important for retail brands
  - [New system architecture diagram](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14SQIJRrK4Qb_oRiNL8j1QylLe9Q86y1T0l_zUjLVlJw/edit).
  - [Feature set and core product loop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OmZ1G8TfrQaRD2C8AvCQTnVGvm6XgRyBUhXFoUwU8Oo/edit#slide=id.g25a001c5ba_0_75).
- Plan for next week
  - Define detailed user group
  - Conduct street interview/coffee-shop interview
  - Prepare for Sprint II
- Key learnings and actions from your weekly retro
  - From crit's past experience: it's okay to start from scratch at anytime if you feel like the direction is not correct
- Risks
  - Not sure on data yet
  - Our product is not a real product, but several additional services to enhance the overall experience
  - Story too long and too fragmented 

  
### Week 9 Elaborate
- Progress this week
  - [User Finding Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWE-j7Homer-LDsxku0t0KVc2QvIAEAuTuOzSl_VRnQ/edit).
    - Key insights:
      - People like recommendation systems in certain settings, but other times they like having the independence to browse on their own.
      - Users put a lot of value in reviews, but rarely contribute themselves.
      - Users will seek out feedback from others by other means if it is not readily provided.
  - [Company Advisor Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHaIM59hrmPUodE0Tm6H_dDI9Gsr21MzidLLj1YTXOM/edit).
  - Move onto generating new ideas
    - Ways to encourage new comments and reviews
      - how to motivate people to do it
      - what's the value of seeing more reviews
- Plan for next week
  - Iron out details for the "review/comment" idea
  - Implementation plan
  - Prepare for Crit II
- Risks
  - Starting from scratch and time is ticking 
  - Investment cost on the technology of recording comments need further validation
  - Not have a diverse enough user interview base to develop solid insights 


### Week 10 Design
- Progress this week
  - Pivot on new idea: a comment app in the brick-and-mortar stores to populate more reviews on items for online shoppers to reference 
  - Validated this new idea with Brian --> showed some initial interst
  - Validated this new idea with Leland --> really positive feedback
    - Recommended interviewing peopele shopping/observing behaviors in JCrew store to generate smart question pool
    - Recommended live video camera to scan item as opposed to laser scanner
  - [New System Diagram](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9ETzEoqK-Atd2pZcG9VWHBTMWc).
  - [Design 5E's]().
  - [Decks for tech talk]().
- Plan for next week
  - field study at J.Crew 
  - Prep for Crit II
  - Prep for Tech Talk
  - Detail defining for comment app
  - Skeleton Codes for comment app
  - Review visualization design on J.Crew website 
- Risks
  - New efficient applications to send item informationt to designated fitting rooms
    - Laser scanning too slow
    - Video scanning too expensive
    - Lack of other options?
  - Value for the comment apps to J.Crew and other retailers not enough
  - Value to the online customers not enough
  - Hard to determine right reward amount and logic for in store commentors 

### Week 11 
- Progress this week 
  - Researched and began implementation for APIs (Natural Language Processing/Sentiment Analysis API and Speech to Text API from Google) 
  - Created first iteration of front end 
  - Finalized scope of product for demo (focus on tops, specifically sweaters) 
  - Conducted more user validation in the form of a survey to understand how reviews affect purchasing decisions 
  - Completed Tech Talk and recieved feedback from peers and advisers on where to focus for Sprint 3 
 - Plan for next week  
  - Link front and back ends 
  - Complete user testing and validation with current version of product 
  - Craft final narrative for Sprint 3 
- Risks 
  - Linking all the moving parts will take some time and testing to work out completely 
  - Building only for a small set of items, so we will have to consider how the product can scale
