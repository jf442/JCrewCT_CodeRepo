- key learnings and actions from your weekly retro
  - we talked too fast during presentation --> bad engagement 
  - focus on the narrative around the prodcut and let the demo support the narrative better
  - incorporate tech related content to the presentation 
- risks
  - starting from scratch, running low on time
  - technology solutions might require high initial investments and more serious validations
